@Copyright 2013 OrderLogix                    


----------


This custom Magento extension will hook onto the Magento OnepageCheckout controller and will gather all of the details of the order and post them in real time via a secure HTTPS post to a specified URL of the OrderLogix OLCC order management system.  The details of the request to OLCC and the response from OLCC will be put into the Magento system logfile.

This extension was developed for Magento Community Edition version 1.7.0.2.                                                
This Extension is intended to be installed in the "local" code pool of your magento implementation.

Please edit the parameters below appropriately for your specific installation.

Please consult with OrderLogix support before making any modifications to the code below.

OrderLogix assumes no responsibility or liability for the use of this code in conjunction with a Magento Community Edition implementation.**
